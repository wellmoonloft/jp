<p>I really enjoy putting all my belongings in the car and moving, and I feel free and carefree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have traveled many times in Beijing, Hong Kong and Macao. Every time, from day to night, from scorching heat to severe winter, there are many fascinating points of long-distance high-speed. Every time I pass the brush, I will have a different experience. This brush itself has a special mood, so The experience is even more different.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will find that some cars are speeding, overloading, merging chaotically, taking emergency passages, driving high beams, especially unruly. Generally, such cars are divided into two categories, one is a foreign car, and you will leave after the gun. One is the local car, the relationship is harder than the rules.</p>
<p>Sometimes you are in a hurry, but the high speed is usually two-lane. Once there is a large truck in front of overtaking, there will be a long string of traffic. You have to slow down and wait for him to go before you go. It’s very helpless, but It can only be accepted.</p>
<p>Sometimes you are highly concentrated and shuttle between two lanes, and finally you find that the one who walks in the same lane honestly is still in front of you.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will find cars all over the world, so irritable that you want to set up a bazooka to blow up all the cars around you.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will find that there is no car around, especially from 2 am to 5 am. You will be very happy at first, but gradually you will feel fear, fear, and worry until there is a idiot behind you. With the high beam getting closer and closer, you realize that you are still alive, so you will be pleased and happy to see him, and then you will wait for him to pass, and then turn on the high beam to chase him, fun.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will compete with the same car to see who drove more elegantly, and then he will leave you in the middle, honking the whistle to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Sometimes a car on the same road will squeeze you into a dead end for petty gain. You are so annoyed that you can kill him, but after a turn, you still go around and find that he has broken down in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will find that most of the cars with far-reaching goals will be more calm, and will be more humble when encountering problems, and will not compete for immediate success or failure.</p>
<p>Sometimes people who get off the road may be farther than your destination. They just don’t follow you anymore.</p>
<p>Sometimes new vehicles will come in, some are just on the road, and some are cars with stories. Whether they leave or just arrived, they have their own stories. Whether they stop or go, they are all independent There is no sense of good or bad in your life.</p>
<p>Sometimes leaving is the beginning.</p>
<h2 id="The-flag-waver-on-Junshan-Bridge"><a href="#The-flag-waver-on-Junshan-Bridge" class="headerlink" title="The flag waver on Junshan Bridge"></a>The flag waver on Junshan Bridge</h2><p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/30/FU1yP6hiQO5zdXv.png"></p>
<p>Passing by the Junshan Bridge, construction is underway on the bridge. In order to avoid passing vehicles that are too fast to merge, an uncle stood at the head of the bridge and waved the flag. The flag was 3 meters high, red and very bright; the flagpole was pure wood and very heavy; the bridge was windy and very strong. It was cold, his face flushed, his arms swayed hard, his eyes were blurred and his nose was running wild. He just stood there all the time, waving the flag.</p>
