<h2 id="Commercial-Real-Estate-and-Internet-Platform"><a href="#Commercial-Real-Estate-and-Internet-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Real Estate and Internet Platform"></a>Commercial Real Estate and Internet Platform</h2><p>It is not so much the plight of commercial real estate as the plight of the real economy.</p>
<p>This dilemma began when the industrial structure was fully tilted towards real estate, and it has become particularly difficult until the full-scale explosion of the Internet industry. The real economy has never been optimistic about the Internet, to embrace the Internet, and then to the saturation of online traffic. The time interval is getting shorter and shorter, leaving less and less time for the real economy to adapt and change.</p>
<p>Because I am in a large commercial real estate company, even if I did not get up to the actual business in the early morning, I began to study the informatization of commercial real estate in 2012 in a strict sense. Since that year, there have been two voices of commercial real estate doing APP and not doing APP. In the end, most companies are not optimistic about APP. The reason is very simple. In that era, the cost of developing and maintaining two APPs was real. It is too high, 2 million at every turn, 5 million to be able to make a look, even if the hybrid base appeared later, it did not fundamentally solve this problem.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the cost of online customer acquisition was very low at that time. WeChat just launched its official account in 2012. Some companies that smell the sweetness began to launch their own WeChat official account to serve as a bridge between shopping malls and customers. Tweets to increase member stickiness, the effect is very good. Operation with almost no cost has further eroded the motivation to make an independent APP.</p>
<p>With good days and good times, domestic commercial real estate exploded vigorously at the end of 2014. It seems that the first to third-tier cities have been spread overnight. There are more and more homogenized products, but in general, there are food for business. Companies of real estate practitioners are also rising. In terms of investment in informatization, do you mean informatization? What information does Lao Tzu want to make money with his eyes closed!</p>
<p>The days when the wind direction changed started in 2017. Commercial projects in various cities were gradually saturated, but there was no change in customer acquisition channels. Entity business relies on Internet platforms such as Dianping, Xiaohongshu, WeChat Official Account, etc. to play a lot of fun, especially the launch of WeChat Mini Programs in 2017, allowing commercial projects to obtain APP-like capabilities once again at almost zero cost. Therefore, using Internet platforms such as Dianping, Xiaohongshu, Douyin, Toutiao, and WeChat official account to attract traffic, and importing it into your own official account + mini program seems to be a standard practice overnight.</p>
<h2 id="Everything-has-changed"><a href="#Everything-has-changed" class="headerlink" title="Everything has changed"></a>Everything has changed</h2><p>It’s time for the harvest. People have tasted the benefits of the Ele.me subsidy, but they don’t know when the fees paid by physical stores to the platform and riders are not free. When the platform matures + user habits are formed, the cut will be cut. Directly killed the physical catering shops. The person who ordered the food did not find it inconvenient, and did not feel that the cost increased. However, there is a difference between the take-out and dine-in food provided by the store, which is the cost of the platform.</p>
<p>When the traffic can be directly monetized, Dianping, Xiaohongshu, Douyin, Toutiao, and WeChat official accounts all cut off the channel of online diversion. You can’t direct the traffic to yourself through the Internet platform now. You can only continue to pay the Internet company’s WeChat official account, H5 page or APP, and divert offline through SP activities. You do the SP activities + Internet platform costs all by you, but the traffic still flows into the public platform pool. You can’t resist, because you don’t have other direct channels to your customers, except SMS.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/30/FXcoOjrdu9ELqNi.png" alt="image-20210218213539598"></p>
<center>Current situation</center>



<p>You have 100,000 followers on the WeChat public account, but you cannot reach them. On average, a person pays attention to more than 50 official accounts. Not everyone will read your message. Even if they read, the actual conversion rate is horribly low, except for non-stop SP activities.</p>
<p>**Even if you don’t do it, someone else will do it. People attracted through SP activities don’t have any loyalty to speak of. **</p>
<p>**he! Do not! Yes! you! of! meeting! member! **</p>
<p>In fact, I said that harvesting seems too cruel, and seems to be hostile to the Internet platform. In fact, it is not. This is the general trend. Whoever does it will do the same. Even if there is no WeChat, there will be Horizon and X letters.</p>
<h2 id="Private-domain-traffic-pool"><a href="#Private-domain-traffic-pool" class="headerlink" title="Private domain traffic pool"></a>Private domain traffic pool</h2><p>It is still the O2O model. In fact, the Internet platform was the first to propose the O2O concept. At that time, in order to attract physical businesses to use the Internet platform for offline diversion, it did play a big role for a long time. In that era where the cost of online drainage is low, and the traffic is free.</p>
<p>And we are now going to make a change in the O2O model. The online drainage platform still exists, but we need to replace it with our own private domain traffic pool. The cost of online customer acquisition cannot increase forever. It will change and stabilize according to market changes, and the cost we invest in is limited.</p>
<p>Taking 100% as an example, 80% of the cost is used for the drainage of the Internet platform, which is a pull new, and the remaining 20% ​​of the cost we have to invest in operating our own private domain traffic platform, which is a revitalization. And it is often this 20% that will create value for the entity business continuously.</p>
<p>Refer to the picture below, your customer acquisition channels include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Active channels: Internet platforms, store activities,</li>
<li>Passive channels: physical commercial brand effect and main store influence</li>
</ol>
<p>All channel traffic is imported into the offline scene, and then imported into your own online marketing APP through the method of sceneization + social marketing. This is your own private domain traffic pool. According to the 2&#x2F;8 principle, this part of users It accounts for 20% of your entire traffic, but it will create 80% of your profits.</p>
<p>And this process I gave it a name called Online To offline Closed-loop, or O2O CL, online and offline closed loop.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2022/12/30/uHABD7hJnFmaoGP.png" alt="image-20210218214121770"></p>
<center>O2O CL</center>



<h2 id="Scene-marketing"><a href="#Scene-marketing" class="headerlink" title="Scene marketing"></a>Scene marketing</h2><p>Many people will start to complain when they see this. What you said is right and wrong. I certainly know that owning my own APP is the best thing. It is a big investment in the beginning but once and for all. Why didn’t we do it before? The old difficulties still exist!</p>
<ol>
<li>High R&amp;D costs</li>
<li>High operating costs</li>
<li>Difficult to install</li>
</ol>
<p>Here I want to avoid the above three problems first, let’s talk about scene marketing. In fact, the concept of scene marketing still comes from the Internet. What concept is it?</p>
<p>**Using media and other services that may appear around consumers at any time, according to the time (Time), place (Place), and environment (Occasion) of consumers, instant information, products or services are provided to meet different scenarios Under the immediate specific needs of different consumers. **</p>
<p>When scenario-based marketing is in progress, it is actually undergoing a dimensional transformation:</p>
<p>**When we grasp the needs of consumers from indicators such as age, gender, hobbies, region, income, etc., we focus on the consumers themselves, and when we grasp the needs of consumers through specific scenarios, we focus on It is an objective environment. It can also be said that we no longer care about consumers’ “who am I” on a large scale of time and space, but focus on “who am I” in a small specific scene. **</p>
<p>Limited by the difficulty of technical realization, we took the consumer’s experience journey as <strong>“demand-purchase-use”</strong> in three steps. Marketing is also facing the embarrassment of separation, and all efforts are basically concentrated on <strong>“ Let consumers realize that they have this need”</strong>, and <strong>“Remember my product and brand when they make a purchase on the channel next time”</strong>.</p>
<p>I believe everyone knows how effective it is. For example, CCTV’s 5 live broadcast nights of the Super Finals are definitely prime time. Among them, Ronaldo endorsed the anti-dandruff shampoo advertisement, you definitely have an impression, perhaps because of Ronaldo, because of the creative advertising, you can bear it. I haven’t changed the channel and I’ve watched a whole advertisement. Maybe in the next month, you will always see this shampoo advertisement on TV, outdoor, subway, magazines and other media. Has it touched you? ? You are chased by him and feel like you have nowhere to escape, but when you run out of shampoo and go to the supermarket, it may be several months later. Do you still remember it? After doing so much marketing effort, you may finally rely on that little impression in your heart, not to be confused by the packaging of the competing product, not attracted by the promotion of the competing product, and correctly picked up this bottle of shampoo and put it into the shopping cart.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it is demand, purchase, or use, consumers have experienced too long, too many media, and too many locations and environments in this process, which makes every marketing effort full of randomness and difficult to continue. However, what’s more terrible is that most people are not willing to spend time and energy to understand a shampoo and communicate in non-demand scenarios. It may not only be the media budget that is wasted, but the marketers have racked their brains to figure it out. Strategic insight and creativity.</p>
<p>What will the Internet industry do? The realization of scene marketing through the rotten streets but definitely a future trend, big data, mobile devices, social networks, positioning systems and other technologies will change this dilemma in the mobile social era. I can give an example, consumption The hair comb (sensor) of the consumer will automatically identify and record the condition of the consumer’s hair and scalp (big data), and predict their growth status. Based on this, it is recommended that a more suitable shampoo for consumers is recommended. Consumers only need to spend time with this shampoo In the brand interaction (social media), click a confirmation, and the existing shampoo can be easily delivered to the home before the empty bottle (location system). In this process, the consumer gets the most suitable shampoo product in real time. He doesn’t have to do homework, he doesn’t have to worry about choosing, and he doesn’t have to worry about how long the shampoo will run out. The smooth experience even makes him unconscious. When one’s own needs exist, they have been satisfied, and the transaction has been completed. </p>
<h2 id="Entity-business-scenario-marketing"><a href="#Entity-business-scenario-marketing" class="headerlink" title="Entity business scenario marketing"></a>Entity business scenario marketing</h2><p>The above example of using the Internet illustrates the horror of scene marketing, which is that the transaction is completed when the consumer is most comfortable, comfortable, unresistible, and unconscious. **So what should be done in the context of physical business marketing?</p>
<p>In the era of mobile internet, the pleasant consumption experience brought by shopping scenes will be further enhanced. Traditional marketing based on activities has become increasingly difficult to touch consumers, while marketing based on scenes that brings actual value to consumers is the future. Suppose a consumer enters a physical business. She is not eager to buy the goods she needs, but searches for the goods she wants to buy in the mobile search box. Based on her location, the search results give her feedback Yes: In the entire physical business, all the stores that sell the items she wants to buy, their names, locations, and prices. She can also sort by sales volume, price, discount strength, etc. After completing the entire process, she can purchase with a targeted . how about it? Does the above beautiful scene experience make you feel awkward? In the era of mobile internet, the pleasant consumption experience brought about by the above-mentioned shopping scenes will be further enhanced, showing the power and future potential of scene-based marketing.</p>
<h3 id="1-Drive-experience-change-with-technological-innovation"><a href="#1-Drive-experience-change-with-technological-innovation" class="headerlink" title="1. Drive experience change with technological innovation"></a><strong>1. Drive experience change with technological innovation</strong></h3><p><strong>(1) Urban Outfitters</strong></p>
<p>The native app developed by the American cheap clothing brand Urban Outfitters is called Urban On (UO). The app will provide users with a lot of personalized services. Users will be encouraged to share their clothing photos with friends. If the sharing is successful, users will get a certain discount. There is also a photo booth for selfies outside the fitting room. Users can also listen to UO radio while shopping. The latest version of the application has updated the product page, and users can see clearer product images and related product information.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Rebecca Minkoff</strong></p>
<p>Rebecca Minkoff (Rebecca Minkoff) bag store and eBay launched an interactive fitting room. Smart mirrors are installed in the fitting room and exhibition hall. Users can click on the mirror to browse products, query product information and place orders. In the fitting room, the user can adjust the indoor light and click on the screen to view the effect of the fitting, instead of holding a pile of clothes into the dressing room; each piece of clothing has an RFID tag, and the user can quickly check whether there is still stock, and click on the desired size After the colors are matched, a staff member will send them to the fitting room. These smart mirrors can also identify customers through the connection software, know what they bought, their consumption history, and what kind of consumption preferences they have. The clerk can use these data to provide customers with better personalized services.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Marc Jacobs</strong></p>
<p>Luxury brand Marc Jacobs launched an event, as long as users post tweets with the hashtag #MJDaisyChain, they can receive a gift in its newly opened Daisy Perfume pop-up store. If it is accompanied by in-store photos, there will be even greater gifts. Every day the best creative content will receive a free Marc Jacobs handbag, which greatly improves the brand’s influence.</p>
<h3 id="2-don’t-do-marketing-but-care"><a href="#2-don’t-do-marketing-but-care" class="headerlink" title="2, don’t do marketing, but care"></a><strong>2, don’t do marketing, but care</strong></h3><p><strong>(1) Really solve the problems and pain points of users, and form a benign value exchange with users</strong></p>
<p>When consumers have learned to recognize and avoid advertisements, traditional advertising persuasive marketing methods become increasingly unworkable. Consumers need products and services that can truly provide them with value. Only scenario-based marketing based on solving current problems for users can form a virtuous circle between users and brands: brands provide users with the information and services they need at the right time and place, which not only helps users, but also provides a better experience. And increase user stickiness. The user’s usage data further promotes the brand to accumulate and discover what users need, so as to provide better services.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Target consumers are no longer limited to the definition of static demographic attributes</strong></p>
<p>In traditional marketing practice, whether it is the target consumer of a brand is usually defined according to the demographic attributes of consumers. However, when considering the target audience of the product from the demand scenario, more potential users can be unexpectedly obtained. For example, Auntie is an app for women’s menstrual management. Based on the needs of girls who want to be cared for by boys during special periods, software vendors have specially developed a male version of the Auntie software. When the girls’ menstrual period comes, the boys can greet the girls. , This software has already had 10% of male users last year.</p>
<h3 id="3-How-to-apply-scenario-marketing"><a href="#3-How-to-apply-scenario-marketing" class="headerlink" title="3. How to apply scenario marketing"></a><strong>3. How to apply scenario marketing</strong></h3><p>The scene marketing of the Internet platform is to use big data, mobile devices, social networks, positioning systems and other technologies to cover all aspects of users’ lives, covering the entire time and space. On the other hand, the scenario marketing of physical business is just the opposite. We have to cover the space and time of users.</p>
<ol>
<li>All scenario marketing and consumer interactions should be carried out around the expansion of private domain traffic and the enhancement of brand image and brand value</li>
<li>Five small events that cater to user habits and concerns may have a budget smaller than a large event, but the benefits may be better</li>
<li>To build an APP that can support AR and VR scenarios, can reach users directly, and can do internal social cycles</li>
<li>It is necessary to establish a big data platform such as consumption path and consumption behavior, and continuously activate services for consumers in its own territory</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="answer-the-questions"><a href="#answer-the-questions" class="headerlink" title="answer the questions"></a>answer the questions</h2><p>Now let us return to the three questions above:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>High R&amp;D costs</p>
<p>With the emergence of platforms such as flutter, the development and maintenance of multi-terminal applications has become possible, and the cost of the background is actually the same as that of small programs. In general, the current cost of simply developing a marketing APP is not much higher than that of the mini program version. The current high part is to cater to the scene marketing for AR or VR technology investment, and these are mini programs or H5 can’t do it. To the thing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>High operating costs</p>
<p>We really can’t spend large sums of money like before 2018, but with the advancement of technology, especially the emergence of big data and crawling technology, we can carry out small activities more accurately. At the same time, the emergence of paying members allows operators to more accurately grasp the whereabouts of activity funds. It is the 20% of paying members who are the main force of profit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Difficult to install</p>
<p>The difficulty of installation is always a paradox. Aunts and grandpas in third-tier cities can sit in the training classroom for two eggs for a morning. WeChat Moments forwarded a bunch of them. Why? User pain points. As long as the user’s pain points are grasped, this problem is not a problem. So what are the user pain points of physical business? In other words, what channels and activities do we need to attract users to install?</p>
<p>You can add my WeChat to communicate.</p>
<p>You see, I saw that the friends here were divided into two groups, 80% of them directly turned off the webpage, and thought this silly X goodbye!</p>
<p>The other 20% will ask, why can’t I find the WeChat ID? We just want to catch these 20% of people!</p>
</li>
</ol>
