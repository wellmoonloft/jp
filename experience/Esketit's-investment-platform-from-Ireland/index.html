    <div class="markdown-body"><p>Today I want to share a p2p investment platform that I have used for nearly a year. It promises an annualized return of more than 10% to 11%. In my experience, it is more than 11% per year. In addition, like peerbeery, it also provides a loyalty program reward. If the investment is activated at 25,000&#x2F;50,000 euros, an additional 0.5%&#x2F;1% return bonus will be added (but only investments in Jordan can enable this program)</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/09/10/kyozCJOZbKR8U7j.png" alt="image-20240910134437903"></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://esketit.com/">Esketit</a> is a multi-lender P2P investment website based in Ireland, with investable products including business loans, short-term loans, etc. It was launched in 2020 slightly later than peerberry, and was founded in December 2020 by Davis Barons and Matiss Ansviesulis, both founders of the highly successful AvaFin Holding (formerly Creamfinance). The group has been profit-focused since its inception in 2012, with continued growth and increasing profitability. Loans are issued by affiliated loan originators, and the entire process is transparent and easy to monitor. Davis and Matiss adopt a “skin in the game” approach, thereby providing more security for investors on the Esketit platform.</p>
<p>Peerberry has actually always been my top choice, but since 2023, they have more investors and fewer lenders. At the same time, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, their loans in Ukraine and Russia have been severely delayed, and a group of users have been lost. But on the bright side, they are the only one? The platform that got the war loan back is still reliable.</p>
<p>But the problem is that I put a lot of money on Peerberry and couldn’t invest. I had to look for similar products on Trustpilot, and then I found Esketit, which has a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/esketit.com">high score of 4.4 points</a> on Trustpilot. You should know that there will be a lot of complaints about P2P investment platforms like this, and 4.4 points is already very high. I checked their 1-point reviews, one of which was about account being stolen, and another was about being unable to register, etc. There was no big problem, so I started my investment on Esketit.</p>
<p>If you are a user of peerberry like me, then Esketit will be very suitable for you. It also has a 60-day default repurchase guarantee. The difference between it and peerberry is:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It has a secondary market, but I don’t recommend it</p>
</li>
<li><p>Its automatic investment strategy has a combination investment method, you can worry-free and let the AI strategy match the investment</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/09/10/P1cBeCwzlf2ZUY7.png" alt="image-20240910134543098"></p>
<p>However, I did not use this strategy. I continued my short-term loan investment method, mainly because of compound interest. Choosing a short-term loan of about 3 to 30 days can make full use of compound interest calculation to quickly increase your wealth.</p>
<p>I found a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator">compound interest calculator</a>. Assuming you have 20,000 euros in principal, compound interest is calculated monthly, and 300 euros are added each month. The annual interest rate is 10%. Then after 5 years, you will get <strong>32,906.18</strong> yuan. If you don’t calculate compound interest, you can only get <strong>32,210.2</strong>. The longer the time, the greater the difference. You spend the same money and the same time, and the difference in 5 years is <strong>695.98</strong>.</p>
<p>Automatic investment options include country, loan term, interest rate and loan originator. It should be noted that some loan originators will have delayed payment. Here is the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://esketit.com/statistics">statistics</a>. Of course, I hope to choose an investment with 100% on-time repayment, but you may not be able to grab it. So instead of worrying about the default rate, it is better to diversify your investments, such as keeping the single amount to 300 euros, so that the risk is spread out and your large funds will not be delayed for 1 to 60 days. I think this is acceptable.</p>
<p>Like Peerberry, their customer service is also friendly. I like to send emails when I have problems, and they are also happy to get feedback from customers.</p>
<h2 id="The-point-l-like"><a href="#The-point-l-like" class="headerlink" title="The point l like"></a>The point l like</h2><ul>
<li>High interest rates - usually 10% to 11%, and short periods (I set up automatic investments for 3 to 30 days, and the single amount does not exceed 300 euros, which can greatly avoid risks)</li>
<li>One of the best designed P2P websites. Simple, beautiful and practical design</li>
<li>Esketit includes multiple lenders, which will provide diversification opportunities.</li>
<li>Most loans have a buyback guarantee. <strong>If the loan is overdue for more than 60 days, the lender will buy back the loan and pay the principal and interest</strong></li>
<li>The website is available in English, German and Spanish</li>
<li>So far, the performance of the loans has been good and transparent, and this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://esketit.com/statistics">statistics</a> is not available on peerberry</li>
<li>The management team is willing to listen to feedback and provide good communication (almost every question is answered within two days, including usage feedback and investment overdue questions)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="question"><a href="#question" class="headerlink" title="question"></a>question</h2><p>This website may attract a large number of peerberry users, and most of them will choose automatic investment. Therefore, if your automatic investment settings are too strict, some funds will not be automatically invested. Therefore, it is better to log in once every two weeks. I hope they can trigger an idle fund reminder, such as sending me an email if there is idle funds for more than a certain number of days.</p>
<h2 id="Risks-and-benefits"><a href="#Risks-and-benefits" class="headerlink" title="Risks and benefits"></a>Risks and benefits</h2><p>Since most loans on Esketit come with a buyback guarantee, it is important to understand the financial situation of each lender. Esketit provides business updates for each loan originator and also shares other financial information.</p>
<p>But to be honest, I didn’t go through the details of each lender. I trusted the Trustpilot rating and my previous experience with P2P platforms. Of course, I still hope that peerberry can get better so that I can invest my money in both platforms. At present, I only keep 1,000 euros in peerbeery because there are really no investment opportunities.</p>
<p>By the way, Esketit is only for residents of the EEA region. You can register with your passport, but you need to have euros. Wise is a good choice. They have linked with Wise and can deposit directly. In addition, bank transfers, including N26 and Revolut, are no problem.</p>

<p>It should be noted that you will get a bonus if you register and invest through the link above. The bonus depends on the amount of investment in the first month, and I will also get a corresponding amount. If you don’t want to give me these bonuses, you can also click here <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://esketit.com/">direct registration</a>, it doesn’t matter, but you are still welcome to click the link above.</p>
